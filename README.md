![AoC 2023 Cover](assets/AdventOfCode2023-2.jpg)
##  🎅 Ho-Ho-Howdy!
If you've stumbled upon this repository, you're either a coding wizard, a recruiter with exceptional 
taste, or Santa Claus himself checking out my code (in which case, hello Santa, I hope the 
algorithms are treating you well at the North Pole).

## 🌟 What is Advent of Code?
Advent of Code is the ultimate coding advent calendar – a series of daily programming challenges 
that will exercise your brain and make you feel like the coding superhero you truly are. It's not 
just about solving problems; it's about mastering the art of coding while sipping on cocoa and 
wearing your favorite elf hat.

## 🎁 What's Inside Santa's Code Bag?
This repository is a collection of my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Each day's 
puzzle is a little gift-wrapped problem that I've gleefully unwrapped and solved using the power of 
code. From cozy arrays to intricate algorithms, I've faced them all like a true coding elf.

## What did I learn doing AoC 2023?
#### 🧩 Problem Solving:
I don't just solve problems; I decorate them with creativity and sprinkle a bit of magic (read: 
elegant code) to make them shine.

#### 🧠 Algorithm Mastery:
I've tamed the wildest reindeer of algorithms and made them work in harmony to solve puzzles faster 
than Rudolph's nose can glow.

#### 🚀 Efficiency is My Sleigh:
My code doesn't just fly; it soars! I believe in writing efficient, scalable solutions that can 
handle the load, just like Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve.

#### 💡 Innovation is My Mistletoe:
I thrive on innovative thinking. When a problem is as tricky as a mischievous elf, I approach it 
with fresh ideas, leaving no bug unturned.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide
##### 1. Clone the Repository:
Grab your coding sleigh and clone this repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodedCraft/adventofcode2023.git

cd adventofcode2023
```
##### 2. Execute any challenge:
In the project's root specify the desired day and part as command-line arguments:
```bash
   cargo run --bin day07 part2
   ```
Replace "day07" with the corresponding day and "part2" with the specific part of the challenge you 
want to run. Get ready to witness the magic unfold! 🎩 🐇

##### 3. Custom Input:
If you wish to use your custom input (must be a `.txt` file), follow these steps:

- Place your input file in the the desired day's folder:
```bash
    src/day09/myinput.txt
```
- Run the program with the following command:
```bash
    cargo run --bin day09 part1 myinput
```

Note: When specifying the input file, exclude the `.txt` extension.

Now, it's not just a directory structure; it's a festive coding adventure! Feel free to let me know 
if you need any more tweaks or additions!
